* Create dist target, to make a release version (bundled and minified)
* Make UI controls (ASC, DESC, N/A)
    * Figure out how to handle custom css+img
* Test test test cases...
    * After porting to require.js it should be possible to do unit tests.
    * Probably jasmine 
    * cli testing via phantomjs? (yet another tool needed :( )
